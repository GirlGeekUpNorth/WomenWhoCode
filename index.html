    <h1>Why should women learn to code?</h1>
    <p>Programming is an important job on today's world. Technology is a big part of everyday lives, and digital solutions are becoming the norm. However, the digital workforce is made of predominantly (white) men, and this causes problems. </p>
    <p>When creating digital solutions, we use our own experiences and perspectives to inform our approach. If our unique perspectives are not represented in this process, then we can't expect the resulting solutions to work for us.</p>

    <p class="important">This means, that if white men make up the majority of people in digital roles, then the majority of digital solutions will be built by white men, and therefore, be solutions suitable for white men.</p>

    <h2>The impact</h2>
    <p>There have been multiple examples of where these solutions have discriminated against women and ethinic minorities, all becuase their voices were not present during decision making, design and testing processes.</p>

    <p>In 2018, Fitbit released backlash after launching their period tracking update because the software restricted people from tracking a period for longer than 10 days. This caused outrage that Fitbit had failed to take into account that some people menstruate for longer than this, and that people should not have limitations placed on how long they can track their period for. Further complaints centered around limitations on trackin symptoms, which were restricted to just five options; cramps, acne, headache, tender breasts, and sick. It was clear that this feature had been developed with little no input from anyone who actually menstruates.</p>

    <h3>Google Images</h3>
    <img id="imageLeft" src="googleimages.jpeg" width="250" alt="image of fitbit's period tracking software">
    <p>Google launched an update to its Images feature in which the content of pictures would be detected using AI and tags would allow for easy searching. Unfortunately, the feature was not tested sufficiently (if at all) on black faces, causing a black people to be labelled as Gorillas. This occured because the AI had not been given enough test data using black faces to be able to recognise them accurately. This is likely as a result of the feature being developed by, and tested mostly on, white males, who make up the majority of people employed as software developers. </p>
